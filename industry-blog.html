            <div class="industry__text-container">
                <p>As an aspiring front-end developer looking to work in the digital industry in under a year’s time, it feels like an exciting, fulfilling and rewarding career to go into. With the ongoing uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the demands on a front-end developer growing, this blog explores the current state of the UK digital industry and where I currently stand as a developer in this rapidly changing industry.</p>

                <h3 class="industry__sub-titles">Brexit and The Industry</h3>

                <p>The chaos what we call Brexit is causing tension and uncertainty for many businesses over the UK – including the digital industry – and I looked to the Manchester Digital Skills Audit and Tech Nation reports to investigate how this chaos may impact my prospects. Manchester Digital Skills Audit (2019) pointed out in their report that over the last two years, business growth by turnover has declined and in the last twelve months only 54% of business reported growth.</p>
                
                <p>Tech UK (2019) stated that 71% of their members said that a no deal Brexit would have a negative impact on their business, so this uncertainty surrounding Brexit may affect my chance of employment upon graduating university.</p>

                <p>It also indicates that there was an 11% decrease in staffing levels, and all this has some direct correlation to the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. In addition, 34% of businesses reported a negative impact on their business with issues such as clients being cautious with investments. These statistics alone can be daunting to someone who will be seeking employment in the digital industry in the next year and how my opportunity for employment can be at risk if the UK come out with a bad deal or no deal.</p>

                <h3 class="industry__sub-titles">Some positive thoughts!</h3>

                <p>On the contrary, Manchester Digital Skills Audit (2019) report that 53% of digital business in Greater Manchester recruit directly from Manchester Metropolitan University and HTML and JavaScript are two of the five most in demand programming languages, both being a strong point of mine and languages being encouraged to improve on my web development degree.</p>

                <p>Also, the role of a developer is set to grow in importance by 29% to businesses over the next three years, and with these two skills along with keeping up to date with current technologies in the industry, chances of employment over the coming months seem more positive.</p>
                
                    
                <p>Tech Nation (2019) state that in 2019, there was over £4.9 billion digital tech turnover in the North West as well as 88,000 currently employed. This highlights that digital businesses are a key figure in the North West, contributing massively to the economy, as well as a large source of employment for people like me soon to be seeking employment within the digital industry.</p>

                <h3 class="industry__sub-titles">My thoughts on the role of a front end developer</h3>
                
                <div class="industry__job-roles">
                    <figure class="industry__job">
                        <img src="img/job-role.png" alt="Job requirements on indeed for front end developer" class="industry__job-img-1">
                    </figure>
                    <figure class="industry__job-1">
                        <img src="img/job-role-1.png" alt="Job requirements on indeed for front end developer" class="industry__job-img-2">
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>When looking at various junior front-end developer roles, the list of skills required can be off-putting, as some of those skills can go beyond the scope of front-end developer. This makes me feel as though I need to learn everything, but as Berner (2016) points out, learning everything at once will be bad because you can’t retain all the information</p>
                    
                <p>Berner (2016) states in his article in Smashing Magazine,imposture syndrome is real and that a large proportion of developers have it. Instead, Berner advises you to focus on one specific topic/skill and when it comes to feeling like an imposter for job roles that feel out of your depth, you don’t have to know everything, but just have an attitude to learn on the job.</p>

                <p>A key factor for me to have a successful career in the digital industry is to stay up to date with current technologies and industry news. Front End Rescue (no date) state in their short but concise article, staying up to date with new tools, technologies and trends requires processes like following industry leaders on social media, attending conference’s, subscribing to relevant newsletters or even finding your own sources like following relevant blogs from industry professionals.</p>
                
                <p>Following steps like this as well as constantly building on and practicing on my current skillset, will boost my chances of getting and maintaining a career as a successful front-end developer.</p>
