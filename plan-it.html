                <p>Plan It was another student project in the second year of University at The Manchester Metropolitan University – but the title of the unit for this project being Digital Project Management. Plan It is a website that showcases places people can go and things people can do within the Manchester City Centre – similar to the Live Music in Manchester website – but this project was more of a focus on project management and how we manage the project instead of the quality of the code and website.</p>
                    
                <p>The team were tasked with producing a prototype digital product of our choice and after a discussion the Plan It website was our idea. There was a team of seven of us involved in this project, it had its ups and downs, but we worked together efficiently and achieved a mark of 70%.</p>

            <p>Similar to the live music project, the team had to pick roles they would like to take in this project, and I put myself forward for the project management role. I do this because I want to be outside my comfort zone and put in situations that test my abilities to organise and execute a project. It was challenging managing this project because like every student project, there can be times when students are not completing the tasks allocated to them and you have to be constantly asking for updates – especially with a deadline looming.</p>

            <p>The Digital Project Management had a mixture of students on a web development degree and digital marketing degree, so our team had a mixture of skillset. I took on the role to code this website as the rest of my team were on the digital marketing degree and not comfortable coding this website. Luckily, I had already taught myself some basic flexbox and css grid from my experience in the Live Music project, so I felt a lot more comfortable coding this website up.</p>

            <h3 class="project__role-title">What went well in this project</h3>
            <p>The start of this project was very challenging and un-organised, so the team had to come together towards the end of the project to work even harder. I give a lot of credit to the team; they did excellent to pull together and produce good standard work.</p>

            <p>Communication was a vital factor to producing a successful project and towards the later phase of the project, the team were great with this. Every team member was airing out their problems with their delegated tasks and asking for feedback on their work, whereas in the beginning of the project this was not happening</p>
            
            <p>We had a mixed range of skills in the group, so it was easier to go capture content such as the images and the creative video one team member produced for the website. The whole team shared the common goal of wanting to do well on this project to achieve a good mark and looking back at this project, we achieved our goal.</p>

        <section class="project__critique">
            <h3 class="project__role-title">My thoughts on what did not go well on this project</h3>
            <p>When looking at this website you will see that it is very basic and lacks content as this was due to a very poor first half of the project. The first half was un-organised and not all the team were giving their full effort – including myself as I was lacking motivation. Due to this, the website lacked content such as images inside places we were displaying that would have been more beneficial to the user and more descriptive information about the places to go. Luckily, this project was marked more on the standard of paperwork supporting the project rather than the quality of the website.</p>
