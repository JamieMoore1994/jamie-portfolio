                    <p>Live Music in Manchester was a website created by me, and a team of three other students. The team were tasked with researching, designing, building and testing a website that showcases to users where they can find live music in Manchester. This was done during the second year of university at The Manchester Metropolitan University on the web development degree.</p>

                    <p>Plan It another group project in university in which we were tasked with creating a website that showcases places you could go to in Manchester City Center. This website was more about how the group performed together - as the unit was called Digital Project Management - rather than being judged on the quality of the website.</p>
