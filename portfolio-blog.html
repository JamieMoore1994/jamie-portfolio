                <h2 class="portfolio__page-title">Research, design and build my own professional portfolio website. How did i do all this?</h2>
                <p>Building a professional personal website that’s all about me, what I do and what I can offer to people is both new and exciting to me. My main priorities for this website was to make sure it looked great, performed great as well as being accessible and usable. This website is meant to help me find employment and showcase my services and portfolio, so trying to do a great job of this project was paramount to me.</p>

                <h3 class="portfolio__sub-titles">Website Research:</h3>
                <p>To begin with, I start with a clean empty canvas and my head a little of ideas on what I can do with my website. To kick start this project off I spent time doing countless number of hours of research looking at other professional web developer’s portfolio websites to gather how they structure and present themselves to you. </p>

                <p>My favourite portfolio website I come across was Andy Clarke’s – who is a highly respected and experienced web designer. His website is unique, beautifully designed, yet simple and easy to use. It had a modern and easy to read typeface, an easy on the eye colour palette that had great colour contrast and an effective way in which he displayed and broke down each of his recent projects. I knew that if I could follow these principles whilst designing a website that looked a fraction as good as this site, it would be a successful project to me. Take a look at <a href = "https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/" class = "blog__links" title = "Andy Clarke's website">Andy Clarke's </a>website yourself</p>

                <p>A main factor of this website is to showcase my recent projects in a simple and easy to understand way. When looking at ways in which to display my recent project, I came across a Twitter thread from Alex Muench – who is a senior product designer – that gave his thoughts on how to display your portfolio website. Muench (2019) stated that you should not only just display your recent projects, but to write about your project in detail such as what you loved and learned about the project, to what you would do differently about the project if you were to do it again. Providing this context to users who may use my website will be a useful feature and allow people to understand how I think and critique my own work.</p>

                <h3 class="portfolio__sub-titles">Website Design:</h3>
                <p>I now need to put all my ideas in my head onto paper and some design ideas visually displayed. A low fidelity wireframe is a perfect design method to do this, as Haas (no date) states, you can gain a better understanding of what you’re building, and your designs are more calculated. Content hierarchy was a main focus when producing my designs as it is important to ensure that the most important content was at the top of the page for the users to see.</p>

                </div>

                <p>Next step is typography, I wanted an easy to read sans-serif typeface for most of the website and ‘Poppins’ seemed the perfect choice for me with its smooth round edges to the letters.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>A theme throughout the site is the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) backgrounds I created – in which I felt gave a modern and dynamic feel to the website. SVG allow for many great possibilities on the web, with the main benefit being all modern browsers support it, has search engine optimisation benefits and SVG images scale any size to fit web pages – whilst keeping the quality of the image (Appnovation, no date). I only use SVG for background images in my portfolio but on future projects I will be sure to take full advantage of SVG images.</p>

                </figure>

                <h3 class="portfolio__sub-titles">Website Build:</h3>
                <p>Now for the exciting part, bringing this project to life. As I gain more experience in building websites, a large factor to help to help the build run smoothly is organisation. CSS files can be large and difficult to maintain and an easy way to stay organised is through the use of CSS custom properties. MDN Contributors (2019) define CSS custom properties as entities created by the person who write the CSS code that contain specific values to be reused throughout the document. I took advantage of this by defining all my colours needed in the root element so that changing or updating colours in the future will be as easy as changing the property’s value.</p>

                <p>To layout my website, I utilise the power and magic of Flexbox and CSS Grid, these tools are amazing. Flexbox allows the items width and height within its container to best fill the available space (CSS Tricks, 2019). CSS grid is a layout system with rows and columns that allow you to design pages without the use of floats and positioning (W3 Schools, no date). Combining these two amazing tools together will pretty much allow you to create any design you can think of!</p>

                            /* Makes card layout responsive, no need for media queries */
                            grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(25rem, 1fr));
                         </code>
                        <figcaption>
                            <p>Two lines of code and this allowed for the blog cards on the blog page to be completely responsive without the use of media queries. The auto-fit creates as many tracks the content needs so that they take up any avaiblable space. I then as for each column to have a minumum width od 25rem (250px) and a maximum width of one fraction of the available space. This is all wrapped in a repeat function allowing each card to align side by side if there is any available space.</p>
